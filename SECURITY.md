## Supported Versions

As this is a community-driven project, we aim to address security vulnerabilities in the latest release. We encourage users to always use the most recent version of the Visual Prompt Builder to ensure they have the latest security patches.

## Best Practices for Users

*   **API Key Security**: Your DeepL API key is sensitive information. Do not expose it in public repositories or client-side code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management for storing and accessing the API key.
*   **Network Security**: When deploying the server, ensure it is running in a secure environment. Limit network access to only trusted sources and consider using firewalls and other security measures.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update the project's dependencies to benefit from security fixes in underlying libraries.

Thank you for helping to keep the Visual Prompt Builder secure.
